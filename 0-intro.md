> "Change is not a threat, it's an opportunity. Survival is not the goal, transformative success is, - Seth Godin"

Working in New Technologies is quite demanding, yet very rewarding. More and more of the production libraries and frameworks we use to create our applications are going to be written using this new version of JavaScript. Instead of waiting on the sidelines, ``we can start using ES6 now`` with the help of transpilers/shim, and enjoy many of the benefits without worrying about browser compatibility.

> ECMA Script 6 Edition has been finally released under [Standard ECMA-262, 6th edition (June 2015)](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm), and is here to stay.


## Goal of the Workshop:
1. Introduction to new ES6 features.
2. How to use these features today.
