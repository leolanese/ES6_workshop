-- 2.9-ES6 Promises [ecma-international.org](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-promise-executor)

ES6 standardise promises and remove the external dependencies currently required to use promises.

> [Promises and "Pyramid of Doom"](https://github.com/kriskowal/q)

1. A Promise can have one of these states:
1.1 Pending: initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.
1.2 Fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully: fulfilled with a value
1.3 Rejected: meaning that the operation failed: rejected with a reason (error).

> A Promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected to in the future.

``A pending promise can become either fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason (error).
As the Promise.prototype.then and Promise.prototype.catch methods return promises, they can be chained—an operation called composition.``

``
New ES6 promises are created through the Promise constructor. This constructor accepts a single argument, which is a function (called the executor) containing the code to execute when the promise is added to the job queue. The executor is passed two functions as arguments, resolve() and reject(). 
``
``
The resolve() function is called when the executor has finished successfully in order to signal that the promise is ready to be resolved while the reject() function indicates that the executor has failed.

### ES6 native Promise pattern
```javascript
// Defining: ES6 Promise Constructor
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { // executor function with: resolve and reject function arguments
  if(true) {
    resolve("worked!");  
  } else {
    reject("didnt work");
  }
});

// Using: ES6 promise instance
promise
  .then(function(result){
    console.log(result);
  }, function(error){
    console.log(error);
  });
```

### ES6 Promises 
```javascript
// Defining Mock Data Service
var data;
function findData(){
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject){
    if (data){
      resolve(data);
    }else{
      reject("data not found");
    }
  });
}

// Using Mock Data Service
promise
  .then(function(data){
    console.log(data);
  })
  catch(function(){
    console.log(error);
  })
```

### ES6 Chaining Promises: Returning Values in Promise Chains
```javascript
let foo = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    return resolve(1);
});

foo.then(function(value) {		// value = 1 from executor 	
    console.log(value);         // "1"
    return value + 1;			// fulfillment handler returns 2	
}).then(function(value) {
    console.log(value);         // "2"
    return value + 1;			// fulfillment handler returns 3
}).then(function(value) {
    console.log(value);         // "3"
});
```
