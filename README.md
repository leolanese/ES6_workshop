ECMA Script 6 is already here, and more and more of the production libraries and frameworks we use to create our applications are going to be written using this new version of JavaScript. Instead of waiting on the sidelines, we can start using ES6 now with the help of transpilers/shim, and enjoy many of the benefits without worrying about browser compatibility.

### “ES6 will change the way you write JS code.”

To tell you the true, when I read this quote it’s scared me a little bit, thinking old code old knowledge could go to the bin.
Reality check: ES6 is an enhancement of ES5. ES6 brings new features, solve few problems and it can be partially or complete incorporated to our code and make things easy to understand.
