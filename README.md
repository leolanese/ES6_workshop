ECMA Script 6 is already here, and more and more of the production libraries and frameworks we use to create our applications are going to be written using this new version of JavaScript. Instead of waiting on the sidelines, we can start using ES6 now with the help of transpilers/shim, and enjoy many of the benefits without worrying about browser compatibility.

# 1- What is ES6?: 

## Goal: Be a better language

### "ES6 will change the way you write JS code."
To tell you the true, when I read this quote it’s scared me a little bit, thinking old code old knowledge could go to the bin.
Reality check: **ES6 is an enhancement of ES5.** ES6 brings new features, solve few problems and it can be partially or complete incorporated to our code and make things easy to understand.

### Why we want to learn ES6?
We are developers, we are progressive. **We want to learn the latest things so we can build the best applications possible.**
We will be ready, our product will be future proof and as a developer we will be more marketable as a coder in the industry, this will positioning an step ahead and we will be ready for AngularJS 2.

### AngularJS 2:
**AngularJS2 it’s going to be a big deal.**
If you worry to get ready to AngularJS2, about being ready from a knowledge standpoint there are some new things that you should know about.

### What can we do right now in order to be up to date when AngularJS 2 comes?
If you want to be ready for AJS2 we can start learning ES6, and **we’ll be ahead of the game**.
We can be ready and prepared focusing on one thing in particular: ES6

### Do I need to migrate my javaScript code to ECMAScript 6?
**There is no need**: ECMAScript 6 is a superset of ECMAScript 5. Therefore, all of your ES5 code is automatically ES6 code. How exactly ES6 stays completely backwards compatible
